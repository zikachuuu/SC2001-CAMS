# SC2001-CAMS

CAMSApp and Utility are in a mess, but other classes are coming tgt(?).
None of the csv stuff has been done. Maybe we can extract data from csv at start of main, and put the new data back to csv only at end of main (so csv updating is only done within CAMSApp and not in individual classes)
