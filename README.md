# SC2001-CAMS

Update 2:
Guys please at least check ur code for syntax error before pushing... Use an ide... ide highlights all the syntax error for u alr.

Update 1:
Removed all errors and added some stuff to CAMSAPP so the code now can actually compile and run! (but of course it does nothing yet)

CAMSApp and Utility are in a mess, but other classes are coming tgt(?).
None of the csv stuff has been done. Maybe we can extract data from csv at start of main, and put the new data back to csv only at end of main (so csv updating is only done within CAMSApp and not in individual classes)
